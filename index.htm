            <li>My favorite museum that we visited was The Vatican Museums.</li>
            <li>We stayed in both Rome (left) and Sorrento (right) which is is Naples.</li>
            <li>My favorite site that we visited was Pompeii and Herculaneum, both destroyed by Vesuvius.</li>
            <li>One of the best parts of the trip was the food from the streets and cafes like the pizza, coffee, and rice balls.</li>
            <li>It was a school trip, so I had about 25 friends there with me which made it really fun.</li>

        <p>This is my trip to Disney World that I went on in January of this year. I also went on this trip with my school, to play with my school band and chorus. We played in Disney Springs the morning after we got there then spent 5 days going to the parks. It was one of the best times of my life because so many of my friends were there and it was also a great deal for how we much we got out of the trip. We got to be able to go to all the parks and we stayed on Disney property so we spent all day in them. We sounded really good in the performances so it just made the trip so much better and started it off well.

        <h3>Lastly in my top 3 is my trip to Mexico that I went on with my family in<br> June of 2022. We stayed in a super nice hotel and the weather was<br> amazing the entire time. While we were there, we went to Tulum, ruins of<br> the Mayan Civilization. We were there for about 10 days. The beaches and <br>jungles we saw on excursions were some of the most beautiful I've ever seen.<br> The food we had here outside of the hotel was some of the best I've ever had.<br>Also, the culture was amazing, the locals were so inviting and very fun to talk<br> to, expecially in Spanish. I took Spanish throughout highschool, so this trip was <br>a great test and I actually did better than I thought I would have. This trip<br> remains a top 3 because of the food and the culture and the beauty of course.</h3>
